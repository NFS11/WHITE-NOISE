# WHITE-NOISE
WHITE NOISE is a Python choice game based off A Quiet Place.

I made WHITE NOISE because I thought a game based off A Quiet Place would've been cool. The first release is a demo. I hope you enjoy it! I will try to release a full game.

How to play:

WHITE NOISE uses save files. The savefile is a .json which is is located in the PWD of the base game. I have made it so that you can save and quit. When you save and quit the savefile is made. You can load it when you open it again. To make it slightly harder, it is kind of random and when you die, the save file is wiped. It is a multiple choice game so there are 5 options on every turn.

How do I start the game?

Just open the .py file. It doesn't matter if it is opened in IDLE or the Shell.

The game lasts 20 turns. Your goal is to either survive to the full 20 turns or get the highest amount of turns survived.

I hope you enjoy this game just as much as I enjoyed playing it! When I release the full length game I will make it better and longer. I will also remove the save file deleting thing lol.

Remember if there is anything you'd like for me to add just ask through Issues and same goes for issues or help. Please consider leaving a star!
